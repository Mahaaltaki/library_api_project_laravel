In this project, the concept of authentication was implemented using JWT tokens, and the service concept was applied to reduce code complexity in the controller. Additionally, the concept of Requests was implemented to validate the input or modified data. Special methods were also created for returning error messages and success messages like: function attributes(),function message(),function faildValidation(),function passedValidation(). The user logs in by entering their email, name, and password, and their information is stored in the database. A regular user can view books, borrow and return them within 14 days, and also rate the books. As for the admin, they have full privileges: they can edit, add, delete, and view both books and users, as well as the records of book borrowings.
